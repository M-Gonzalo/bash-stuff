Random scripts and snippets to automate menial tasks

### [installDependencies.sh](./installDependencies.sh)
This script will angrily look for folders named "homework" that have a "package.json" file and perform a simple "npm install" operation on them. Built with [soyhenry.com's](https://www.soyhenry.com/) bootcamp students in mind.

It's also commented on painful detail, just in case some misguided soul stumbles upon it and tries to use it to learn bash.

Written with love and closely following the spirit of Larry Wall's [Three Cardinal Virtues](https://avdi.codes/the-three-virtues/) of a programmer: Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris.
